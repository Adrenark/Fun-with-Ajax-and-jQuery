# Fun-with-Ajax-and-jQuery

This is one of few projects that I've made during classes in my university.

This is website with couple of buttons that react differently.
For example:
-"Kliknij i zobacz w konsoli debugera" shows a list copied from other site.
-"qwe" is mouseover button that makes that button wider.
-"DIV" may not look like a button, however whenever you click it it will become larger.
